********PLEASE MAKE SURE THE CAPS LOCK IS OFF WHEN PLAYING*********

This game is a simplified version of the game tennis. I based the code mainly from ping pong. I added my own sprites and added sound of actual tennis racket hitting
the racket. For the colours, I decided to keep it light and pastel. If I could improve the game, I would add a timer and a loop that allows the user to try again instead of pressing the 'x' button. Also, I could've added levels to the game and make the game harder e.g. adding more balls or make the ball go faster.
In the game, I added a splash screen that I created which was the hardest part since I had to create it using a module called easyGui.
